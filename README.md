--------------------------

A Meteor package that automatically shows a [NProgress.js](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) progress bar during DDP data exchange.

(In plain words, it automatically adds a slick-looking, unintrusive progress bar and a spinner at the top of your web app for any loading activities in your Meteor app.)

##Compatibility
Tested on Meteor 1.0.0.

##Usage

Run the following [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) command:

    meteor add settinghead:auto-nprogress


And you are done!

Now all your Meteor applications will automatically display an NProgress bar whenever a DDP subscription takes place.

##Make Exceptions for Certain Subscriptions

If you do not wish to show NProgress for specific subscription events, change your Meteor subsciption code from

    Meteor.subscribe(...)

into

    Meteor.withoutBar.subscribe(...)

##Styling & Customization

If you wish to change the apprearance of the progress bar (e.g. color, width, etc.) , create your custom CSS classes that overrides the default, and include your CSS file in your project. [See NProgress doc here](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress/#customization).
